    <h1>WHY HUSSIAN </h1>
  <P>My Name is Chris G Paivey there are several reasons for which I have decided to attend the Hussian college, I will  start by saying I'm in this college because I want to aquire the full knowledge required to becoming a successful computer programmer, I also want to be part of a professional environment that seek to solve daily life problem that humans are face with through the development of compuer program  system that can be easly acess by anyone irrespective of their educational background , and lastly I want a career that will help me be financially free and be able to raise a family, not a job that will have hostage and indepted for the cost of my living. I’m from the hospitality industry for several years I have hated what I’m doing as job, so after lot of research for change I came across the Hussian college computer program bootcamp that I saw was a step to the changes that I have been looking for, I was led here by my passion for change and search for career not a job. </P>
